# Code Structure

The code structure is the same as HELM's.
Refer to the HELM documentation [here](https://crfm-helm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code/).

When adding new scenarios and metrics for image generation, place the Python files under the `image_generation` package 
(e.g., `src/helm/benchmark/scenarios/image_generation`).
